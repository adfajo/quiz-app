# quiz_app

A simple quiz app created by Adrian and Di through the IDATA2503 course at NTNU

## Additional feature
When creating an additional feature it was decided that it shouldn't influence the app too much, but still be a nice feature that would be handy for the user. The feature that was added was the option to be able to go back to the previous question in case of a miss-click or the user wants to redo their answer.

## App architecture
This whole application is written inside the lib folder. All the other folders are used by Flutter to compile the code written inside the lib folder to different platforms such as Android, IOS, web, etc. 

The app consists of multiple dart files that all play a part in the structure of this application. Some are custom Widgets while others have actual code logic inside of them.

## Specifications
To run this application you will need an emulator that can emulate an Android device, IOS device or it may also be run on the web. However the app is optimized for running on a phone.

## Folder structure
Inside the assets folder are assets used inside the project, in this case we only have a singular asset. All of the code files are inside the lib folder that contains multiple other folders to have some structure to it.

## User stories
As a user I want to be able to choose between multiple answers and test my knowledge when going through this quiz.

As a user I want to be able to go to the previous question if I somehow miss-clicked the wrong answer or need more time to think of the correct answer.
